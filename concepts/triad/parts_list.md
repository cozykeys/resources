### Ribbon Cables

The keyboard is currently designed such that the three pieces are connected
with IDC ribbon cables. These are easier to solder by hand and because the
cable can be cut and crimped at any point, the lengths are customizable.

The other advantage is that the connectors are more durable.

In the future, I may update the board to use Molex FFC/FPC instead. See:

I would probably use the jumper cable with ears because they add more strength
to the connectors. I'm not sure how well they would do with the three keyboard
pieces being separate and constantly moved; however, if I were to design a 3D
case, these would be more convenient.
